The Iranian-Americans' Contributions Project (IACP) is a charitable, educational, and tax-exempt organization registered in the State of California and active across the United States. Our mission is to document and highlight the professional achievements and the contributions of Iranian-Americans to the United States and, by extension, to the world.

With a focus on the professions, the arts, and the world of business and entrepreneurship, the IACP maintains an active database and an information clearinghouse of Iranian-Americans active in fields such as engineering, medicine, law, civil service (including military and law enforcement), real estate, as well as high technology and entrepreneurship. IACP has a special interest in highlighting the presence of community members across American universities and their contributions to the advancement of the sciences and humanities.

We wish to complement the work that other Iranian American organizations do by providing information that is obtained in a systematic and objective fashion. We are non-political and have no religious affiliations.
